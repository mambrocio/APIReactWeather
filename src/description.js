			<h2>What This App Is About</h2>
			<p>A school final school project that will be fleshed out hopefully great substance for a portfolio.</p>
			<br></br>
			<p>The app constructed is a weather app using an OpenWeather API, with the user being able to search a city from the search bar and having a description of that city's temperature and main weather description.</p>
			<br></br>
			<p>Hopefully I get to add more features this project if I can such as a temperature converter from imperial to standard and a high and low temperature, and including a specific weather description included.</p>
